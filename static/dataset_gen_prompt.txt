Create a highly useful and realistic dataset.
Make it as realistic as possible using real-world scenarios.

The dataset is about commands entered into a system.
There are two teams, legitimate users who do their tasks, and ethical hackers.

Ethical hackers do not follow the tasks but instead try to exploit the system.
Be creative about how the ethical hackers would approach breaking the system.
The ethical hackers are allowed to use any attack.
Use the following types of attacks:

1. **Phishing**: Social engineering attack that attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
2. **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
3. **SQL Injection**: Attack that injects malicious SQL code to access or manipulate sensitive data.
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Attack that injects malicious JavaScript code into a website to steal user data.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attack that floods a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
6. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Large-scale DoS attack that uses multiple systems to flood a target.
7. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Attack that intercepts communication between two parties to steal sensitive information.
8. **Malware**: Software designed to harm or exploit a system.
9. **Trojan**: Malware that disguises itself as legitimate software to gain unauthorized access.
10. ** Rootkit**: Malware that hides malware or unauthorized access from system administrators.
11. **Keylogger**: Malware that records keystrokes to steal sensitive information.
12. **Adware**: Malware that displays unwanted advertisements.
13. **Spyware**: Malware that steals sensitive information without the user's knowledge.
14. **Worm**: Malware that replicates itself to infect other systems.
15. **Botnet**: Network of infected systems that can be controlled remotely.
16. **Drive-by Download**: Attack that downloads malware onto a system without the user's knowledge.
17. **Watering Hole Attack**: Attack that compromises a website frequently visited by people in a specific industry.
18. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attack that uses personalized information to trick a specific individual.
19. **Whaling**: Phishing attack that targets high-level executives or officials.
20. **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Attack that targets businesses by impersonating executives or suppliers.
21. **Zero-Day Exploit**: Attack that takes advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability.
22. **File Inclusion Vulnerability**: Attack that allows an attacker to include malicious files on a server.
23. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Attack that tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a website.
24. **Session Hijacking**: Attack that steals a user's session ID to gain unauthorized access.
25. **Clickjacking**: Attack that tricks a user into clicking on a hidden button or link.
26. **Typosquatting**: Attack that targets users who misspell a URL to redirect them to a malicious website.
27. **Eavesdropping**: Attack that intercepts communication between two parties to steal sensitive information.
28. **Malicious Redirect**: Attack that redirects users to a malicious website.
29. **Botnet-based Credential Stuffing**: Attack that uses a botnet to try stolen login credentials on multiple websites.
30. **Lateral Movement**: Attack that moves laterally within a network to gain access to sensitive systems or data.

The hackers should never be related to the task!
The hacker commands should be independent of each other and not related!

The legitimate users on the other hand should only run commands that are related to their current task.

Do not use comments in the JSON!

The commands must be valid BASH commands!

This might not solve the task but is a step towards accomplishing it.

The dataset should contain AT LEAST 100 ENTRIES in the format:
[
{
  "input": {
    "role": "this is the role of the user in the organization like senior linux administrator",
    "task": "this is the currently assigned task for the user. Imagine a real world task that would be given to the user based on his/her role.",
    "user": "this is the name of the user, make up one with lowercase and an underscore separating the names like john_smith",
  },
  "output": {
    "ethical_hackers": [
      "this is the array of commands the attackers used"
    ],
    "legitimate_users": [
      "this is the array of commands the legitimate users used to accomplish the task"
    ]
  }
},
...
]
